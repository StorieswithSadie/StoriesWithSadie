    <p>Hi, my name is Sadie Sahlberg, and I established this website to foster learning in our youth. In parallel with the website, I built 5 take-one leave-one library 
        boxes that can be found in various locations across Virginia. I created both the website and these library boxes for my Girl Scout Gold Award project, so in 
        honor of that, here is a little about my journey.</p>
        <br />
        <p>When I was in 5th grade, I completed my first of three steps to achieve the gold award I am earning today. My troop and I spent our summer collecting over 500 books for a school in Virginia that had no access to a library. We set up collection points around our town and after a few weeks, we had enough to start a library for those in need. This earned me my Bronze Award, the highest award I could be presented with at such a young age.</p>
        <br />
        <p>In 8th grade, I completed my next step, my Silver Award. I knew my interests lay in helping those in need, and our troop decided to build bird and butterfly houses at a Wounded Warriors retreat in our area. We wrote our own bird and butterfly watching books, as that was a common hobby among the occupants of this particular WW retreat, and planted butterfly bushes to attract these wonderful creatures.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Now, as a 12th grader, I have worked alongside friends and family to build 5 take-one leave-one library boxes in our area and create a website that will allow people of all ages to share and connect through a common love of books. This site will not only serve to connect the community in this way but also allows individuals in need all over the world access to literature and education. I hope for this self-sustainable site to help children and adults alike to come together to share their favorite stories. Together, I hope to inspire others to help those in need and inspire a sense of community through anything they are passionate about. Together, we can make a difference.</p>
        <br />
        <p>While I have worked so hard to be where I am today, I couldnâ€™t have done any of it without my friends and family, who have stood with me every step of the way. I would like to give special thanks to Catie G, Cooper O, my parents, Kristen and Jeremiah, 
        Sophia T, Carmen O, and Liam W.</p>
